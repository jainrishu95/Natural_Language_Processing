This project has a generalised part-of-speech(POS) tagger coded using python using HMM Viterbi Algorithm. The model can trained on tagged-corpus 
of English, Hindi and Chinese and learn respective parameters from it - Transition Probability(A) and Emission Probability(B).
The trained model can predict POS-tagger for the language it's trained on. This model was tested on three different languages and test accuracy on all three are :

English:    0.888468423972

Chinese:    0.869547119547

Hindi:      0.924188540785
