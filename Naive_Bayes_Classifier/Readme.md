This project uses Naive-Bayes classification algorithm to classify Hotel Reviews.
The hotel-review is classified as True/Fake and Pos/Neg indicating whether the review is true or fake and positive or negative.
For each, a separate classification model is trained based on the training cotpus data. The trained model achieves the following results : 

| Class Label | Class Precision | Class-Recall | F1-Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| True | 0.95 | 0.87 | 0.91 |
| Fake | 0.88 | 0.95 | 0.91 |
| Pos | 0.93 | 0.95 | 0.94 |
| Neg | 0.95 | 0.93 | 0.94 |

Mean F1(for all four classes) :  0.9234
